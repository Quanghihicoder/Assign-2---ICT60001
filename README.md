# If you want to run: 

You may grade many students at the same time, so it is better to run "test.bat /m", and then choose option 3 to clear the env variables as their VERAPASS may remain.

Make sure C:\ is your computer disk letter and Z:\ is not mounted with any volume.

In the script file, the volume path is a fixed value: "C:\Apps\103579765.tc" and the sentinel value is "Z:\103579765.txt" (The assignment desc said ok to use this, but if you run on your computer please kindly check this)

Make sure your Windows (virtual) machine has installed VeraCrypt (The assignment desc assumed it is installed) 

# Thank you!
